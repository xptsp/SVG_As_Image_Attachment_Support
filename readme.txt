[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows the forum to properly process a SVG file so that it is displayed as an image beneath the post, complete with original image dimensions and size, instead showing of a download-only link for the SVG file.

Please note that this does not change any existing SVG file attachments so that they can be viewed.  Only [b]NEW[/b] SVG files are processed!
